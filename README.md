###### Theory of Algorithms - Exercise 2
# Anagrams

In this exercise we will look at dealing with anagrams in Python.

## Exercises

1. Download the list of words from [this website](http://georgeflanagin.com/dictionaries/mit.10000.words.txt).

1. Write a script which outputs all words of length nine from that words list to a new file.

1. Write a function which takes a string as input and returns a list containing all anagrams of that string (whether the anagram is an English word or not.

1. Write a script which takes as input a single nine-character string, and checks if it is an anagram of any of the words in the list of nine letter words. 

## Advanced exercises

1. Read up about the [timeit Python module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html) and use it to time your function that generates the list of anagrams.
